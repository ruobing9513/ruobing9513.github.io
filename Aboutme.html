			My name is Ruobing Su and I am a first year graduate student of Northeastern's School of Journalism's Media Innovation Program.
			<br> 
			I have been spending my past four years studying journalism in Northeastern as well and enjoy the life in Boston so much. 
			<br>
			Not a coder or "techy" person, I am pretty much a traditional reporter who literally writes stories, until recently I was awared of the importance of technology and coding playing out in the journalism world. 
			<br>
			I have previously done some simple data visualization stories and multimedia pieces, which are challenging but interesting. 
			<br>
			Taking this course will surely equip me with better knowledge of the technical side of media at practice. 
			<br>
			I come from Ningbo, a small but not that small city near Shanghai in China. 
			<br>
			I love music, especially K-pop and R&B. Ironically, not much Chinese pop music, blah. 
			<br>
			I love cooking - probably I will add a page of my cooking, ha. 
			<br>
			I love Bruno Mars and Charlie Puth (they are just good at singing that make me hum all the time,) and Super Junior, Jay Park, and Mamamoo, as one of the most outstanding Korean pop stars. 
			<br>
			Yay!
