      <p id="para">
        <br>
      	My name is Ruobing Su and I am a graduate student of Northeastern's School of Journalism's Media Innovation Program. I have been spending my past four years studying journalism in Northeastern as well and enjoy the life in Boston a lot. 
      	<br>
      	<br>
      	I come from Ningbo, a small but not that small city near Shanghai, China. Before coming to Boston, I have spent all my life growing up and studying there for 18 years. I have been interested in writing and learning about people all the time, and really got into reporting during high school - that's one of the reasons of choosing journalism. 
      	<br>
      	<br>
      	I like traveling and taking photos. I love music, especially K-pop and R&B. Cooking is one of my biggest everyday hobby - food makes me happy. 
      	<br>
      	<br>
      	Not a coder or "techy" person, I am pretty much a traditional reporter, until recently I was awared of the importance of technology and coding playing out in the journalism world. I have previously done some simple data visualization stories and multimedia pieces. Although coding is something new and challenging for me, so far I have been enjoying doing that and witnessing my progress step by step. In my website, I will be presenting some of my class works and works I have done during my spare time.
